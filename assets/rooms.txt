s You're in a large room,
s You're in a small room,
s You're in a long corridor,
s You're in an oddly shaped room,
s You're in a room, but you're not sure this room has any particular shape or form,
s You're in a notably bland room in the shape of a square,

p its walls laid out of big gray stone, that once must have been even bigger rocks living their humble lives in the steppes plains.
p the walls are of humble brick.
p its prominently boring stone bricks are decorated with intriguing paintings. One of them appears to look like Barack Obama, a person coincidentally of no importance in the world of Rhovanar.
p a cold breeze caresses your face lightly when you suddenly feel its icy cold fingers trace the back of your spine. You feel betrayed.
p you feel a strong presence of magic in the air. It's probably nothing.
p a foul stench enters your nostrils, partying with you turbinate and hitting on your oropharynx. It makes you slightly nauseous.
p its really just that.
p you feel a pleasant vibe in the air, but your feeling have betrayed you before.
p for a moment you could've sworn you'd been here before.
p the floor is made of a nice shaggy carpet. It feels nice even through the thick leather of your muddy boots.
p the air in this room is damp and cold.

m It has a dark feeling to it as it this was just the room for a sleezy teenager and his dog to go on a ghost investigation.
m For a moment you see a bright flash of octarine, but you couldn't make out what colour it really was.
m In the air you smell evilness. Some monsters must have been here before you.
m And there isn't really more to it. With yet another boring room you reflect on your self if the quest you are on was the right choice after all.

f In what would normally be called the corner there is a small little table.
f It's awefully empty, it makes you wonder why this room is even here.
f There's a huge treasure chest at the other end of the room. It would have been really awesome if it had more gold in it, and less rat droppings.
f An unrealistic amount of hay is scathered all about the floor.
f The room is full of torture equipment, all of them are awefully clean. It makes it even more eerie.
f It's empty, as if this room came right of a room generator written by an author with lack of fantasy.
f There's an aweful lot of nothingness stored in this room.
f You feel as if this is the 2000th room you've visited, it almost becoming dull.
