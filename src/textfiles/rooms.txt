*																									*
* Zie hieronder voorbeelden om rooms samen te stellen:																			*
* 																									*
* Shape/size:																								*
* - You're in a large room,																						*
* - You're in a small room,																						*
* - You're in a long corridor,																						*
* - You're in an oddly shaped room,																					*
* - You're in a room, but you're not sure this room has any particular shape or form,															*
* - You're in a notably bland room in the shape of a sqaure, 																		*
*																									*
* Properties:																								*
* - its walls laid out of big gray stone, that once must have been even bigger rocks living their humble lives in the steppes plains.									*
* - the walls are of humble brick.																					*
* - its prominently boring stone bricks are decorated with intriguing paintings. One of them appears to look like Barack Obama, a person coincidentally of no importance in the world of Rhovanar.	*
* - a cold breeze caresses your face lightly when you suddenly feel its icy cold fingers trace the back of your spine. You feel betrayed.								*
* - you feel a strong presence of magic in the air. It's probably nothing.																*
* - a foul stench enters your nostrils, partying with you turbinate and hitting on your oropharynx. It makes you slightly nauseous.									*
* - its really just that.																						*
* - you feel a pleasant vibe in the air, but your feeling have betrayed you before.															*
* - for a moment you could've sworn you'd been here before.																		*
* - the floor is made of a nice shaggy carpet. It feels nice even through the thick leather of your muddy boots.											*
* - the air in this room is damp and cold.																				*
*																									*
* More properties:																							*
* - It has a dark feeling to it as it this was just the room for a sleezy teenager and his dog to go on a ghost investigation.										*
* - For a moment you see a bright flash of octarine, but you couldn't make out what colour it really was.												*
* - In the air you smell evilness. Some monsters must have been here before you.															*
* - And there isn't really more to it. With yet another boring room you reflect on your self if the quest you are on was the right choice after all.							*
*																									*
* Furniture:																								*
* - In what would normally be called the corner there is a small little table.																*
* - It's awefully empty, it makes you wonder why this room is even here.																*
* - There's a huge treasure chest at the other end of the room. It would have been really awesome if it had more gold in it, and less rat droppings.							*
* - An unrealistic amount of hay is scathered all about the floor.																	*
* - The room is full of torture equipment, all of them are awefully clean. It makes it even more eerie.													*
* - It's empty, as if this room came right of a room generator written by an author with lack of fantasy.												*
* - There's an aweful lot of nothingness stored in this room.																		*
* - You feel as if this is the 2000th room you've visited, it almost becoming dull.															*
